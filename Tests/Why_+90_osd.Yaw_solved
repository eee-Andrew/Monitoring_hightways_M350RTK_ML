Why am I adding +90° to the OSD yaw?

This is the only slightly “tricky” part, so I’ll spell it out.

The code itself works in an ENU-like world frame:

x axis ≈ East

y axis ≈ North

z axis up

The rotation Rz(yaw) is a standard math rotation:

yaw = 0° → facing +x (East)

yaw = 90° → facing +y (North)

In many drone OSDs, however, the “yaw” / “heading” is reported in a more “navigation” style:

0° = North

90° = East

180° = South

270° = West

So the OSD yaw and the yaw used inside the math do not share the same zero direction and sign convention.

When I started validating this against ground truth, I noticed a systematic rotation error:
the reconstructed rays were consistently rotated relative to where they should be.

By comparing against known points and map features, I found that:

To align the OSD yaw with the yaw convention used in the solver,
I need to add +90° before passing it to --drone_yaw.
